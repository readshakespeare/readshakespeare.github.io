</section>



			<p class="character">Leonato </p>
			<p class="prose">I learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Arragon comes this night to Messina</p>
			<p class="character">Messenger </p>
			<p class="prose">He is very near by this. He was not three leagues off when I left him</p>
			<p class="character">Leonato </p>
			<p class="verseline">How many gentlemen have you lost in this action? </p>
			<p class="character">Messenger </p>
			<p class="verseline">But few of any sort, and none of name</p>
			<p class="character">Leonato </p>
			<p class="prose">A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers. I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio</p>
			<p class="character">Messenger </p>
			<p class="verseline">Much deserv’d on his part, and equally rememb’red by Don Pedro. He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age, doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion. He hath indeed better bett’red expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how</p>
			<p class="character">Leonato </p>
			<p class="verseline">He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it</p>
			<p class="character">Messenger </p>
			<p class="prose">I have already delivered him letters, and there appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness</p>
			<p class="character">Leonato </p>
			<p class="verseline">Did he break out into tears? </p>
			<p class="character">Messenger </p>
			<p class="verseline">In great measure</p>
			<p class="verseline">Leonato </p>
			<p class="prose">A kind overflow of kindness. There are no faces truer than those that are so wash’d. How much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping! </p>
			<p class="character">Beatrice </p>
			<p class="verseline">I pray you, is Signior Mountanto return’d from the wars or no? </p>
			<p class="character">Messenger </p>
			<p class="prose">I know none of that name, lady. There was none such in the army of any sort</p>
			<p class="character">Leonato </p>
			<p class="verseline">What is he that you ask for, niece? </p>
			<p class="character">Hero </p>
			<p class="verseline">My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua</p>
			<p class="character">Messenger </p>
			<p class="verseline">O, he’s return’d, and as pleasant as ever he was</p>
			<p class="character">Beatrice </p>
			<p class="prose">He set up his bills here in Messina and challeng’d Cupid at the flight, and my uncle’s fool, reading the challenge, subscrib’d for Cupid and challeng’d him at the burbolt. I pray you, how many hath he kill’d and eaten in these wars? But how many hath he kill’d? For indeed I promised to eat all of his killing</p>
			<p class="character">Leonato </p>
			<p class="prose">Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much; but he’ll be meet with you, I doubt it not</p>
			<p class="character">Messenger </p>
			<p class="verseline">He hath done good service, lady, in these wars</p>
			<p class="character">Beatrice </p>
			<p class="prose">You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it. He is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an excellent stomach</p>
			<p class="character">Messenger </p>
			<p class="verseline">And a good soldier too, lady</p>
			<p class="character">Beatrice </p>
			<p class="verseline">And a good soldier to a lady; but what is he to a lord? </p>
			<p class="character">Messenger </p>
			<p class="prose">A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuff’d with all honourable virtues</p>
			<p class="character">Beatrice </p>
			<p class="prose">It is so indeed. He is no less than a stuff’d man; but for the stuffing--well, we are all mortal</p>
			<p class="character">Leonato </p>
			<p class="prose">You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her. They never meet but there’s a skirmish of wit between them</p>
			<p class="character">Beatrice </p>
			<p class="prose">Alas, he gets nothing by that! In our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and now is the whole man govern’d with one; so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother</p>
			<p class="character">Messenger </p>
			<p class="verseline">Is’t possible? </p>
			<p class="character">Beatrice </p>
			<p class="prose">Very easily possible. He wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the next block</p>
			<p class="character">Messenger </p>
			<p class="verseline">I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books</p>
			<p class="character">Beatrice </p>
			<p class="prose">No. An he were, I would burn my study. But I pray you, who is his companion? Is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil? </p>
			<p class="character">Messenger </p>
			<p class="verseline">He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio</p>
			<p class="character">Beatrice </p>
			<p class="prose">O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease! He is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! If he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a thousand pound ere ‘a be cured</p>
			<p class="character">Messenger </p>
			<p class="verseline">I will hold friends with you, lady</p>
			<p class="character">Beatrice </p>
			<p class="verseline">Do, good friend</p>
			<p class="character">Leonato </p>
			<p class="verseline">You will never run mad, niece</p>
			<p class="character">Beatrice </p>
			<p class="verseline">No, not till a hot January</p>
			<p class="character">Messenger </p>
			<p class="verseline">Don Pedro is approach’d</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Enter Don Pedro, Claudio, Benedick, Balthasar, and John the Bastard</h2>
			<p class="character">Don Pedro </p>
			<p class="prose">Good Signior Leonato, are you come to meet your trouble? The fashion of the world is to avoid cost, and you encounter it</p>
			<p class="character">Leonato </p>
			<p class="prose">Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your Grace; for trouble being gone, comfort should remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave</p>
			<p class="character">Don Pedro </p>
			<p class="prose">You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this is your daughter</p>
			<p class="character">Leonato </p>
			<p class="verseline">Her mother hath many times told me so</p>
			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="verseline">Were you in doubt, sir, that you ask’d her? </p>
			<p class="character">Leonato </p>
			<p class="verseline">Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child</p>
			<p class="character">Don Pedro </p>
			<p class="prose">You have it full, Benedick. We may guess by this what you are, being a man. Truly the lady fathers herself. Be happy, lady; for you are like an honourable father</p>
			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="prose">If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as like him as she is</p>

</div>
			<p class="character">Beatrice </p>
			<p class="verseline">I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior Benedick</p>
			<p class="verseline">Nobody marks you</p>
			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="verseline">What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living? </p>
			<p class="character">Beatrice </p>
			<p class="prose">Is it possible Disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick? Courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come in her presence</p>
			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="prose">Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I am loved of all ladies, only you excepted; and I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart, for truly I love none</p>
			<p class="character">Beatrice </p>
			<p class="prose">A dear happiness to women! They would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that. I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me</p>
			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="prose">God keep your ladyship still in that mind! So some gentleman or other shall scape a predestinate scratch’d face</p>
			<p class="character">Beatrice </p>
			<p class="prose">Scratching could not make it worse an ‘twere such a face as yours were</p>
			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="verseline">Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher</p>
			<p class="character">Beatrice </p>
			<p class="verseline">A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours</p>
			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="prose">I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and so good a continuer. But keep your way, a God’s name! I have done</p>
			<p class="character">Beatrice </p>
			<p class="verseline">You always end with a jade’s trick. I know you of old</p>
			<p class="character">Don Pedro </p>
			<p class="verseline">That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudio and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month, and he heartly prays some occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no hypocrite, but prays from his heart</p>
			<p class="character">Leonato </p>
			<p class="verseline">If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.  </p>
			<p class="verseline"><span class="stage_directions_inline">[To Don John]</span></p>
			<p class="verseline">Let me bid you welcome, my lord. Being reconciled to the Prince your brother, I owe you all duty</p>
			<p class="character">Don John </p>
			<p class="verseline">I thank you. I am not of many words, but I thank you</p>
			<p class="character">Leonato </p>
			<p class="verseline">Please it your Grace lead on? </p>
			<p class="character">Don Pedro </p>
			<p class="verseline">Your hand, Leonato. We will go together</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Exeunt. Manent Benedick and Claudio</h2>
			<p class="character">Claudio </p>
			<p class="verseline">Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato? </p>
			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="verseline">I noted her not, but I look’d on her</p>
			<p class="character">Claudio </p>
			<p class="verseline">Is she not a modest young lady? </p>
			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="prose">Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for my simple true judgment? or would you have me speak after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex? </p>
			<p class="character">Claudio </p>
			<p class="verseline">No. I pray thee speak in sober judgment</p>
			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="prose">Why, i’ faith, methinks she’s too low for a high praise, too brown for a fair praise, and too little for a great praise. Only this commendation I can afford her, that were she other than she is, she were unhandsome, and being no other but as she is, I do not like her</p>
			<p class="character">Claudio </p>
			<p class="prose">Thou thinkest I am in sport. I pray thee tell me truly how thou lik’st her</p>
			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="verseline">Would you buy her, that you enquire after her? </p>
			<p class="character">Claudio </p>
			<p class="verseline">Can the world buy such a jewel? </p>
			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="prose">Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this with a sad brow? or do you play the flouting Jack, to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take you to go in the song? </p>
			<p class="character">Claudio </p>
			<p class="verseline">In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I look’d on</p>
			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="verseline">I can see yet without spectacles, and I see no such matter. There’s her cousin, an she were not possess’d with a fury,exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the last of December. But I hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you? </p>
			<p class="character">Claudio </p>
			<p class="prose">I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the contrary, if Hero would be my wife</p>
			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="prose">Is’t come to this? In faith, hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion? Shall I never see a bachelor of threescore again? Go to, i’ faith! An thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away Sundays</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Enter Don Pedro</h2>
			<p class="verseline">Look! Don Pedro is returned to seek you</p>
			<p class="character">Don Pedro </p>
			<p class="verseline">What secret hath held you here, that you followed not to Leonato’s? </p>
			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="verseline">I would your Grace would constrain me to tell</p>
			<p class="character">Don Pedro </p>
			<p class="verseline">I charge thee on thy allegiance</p>
			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="prose">You hear, Count Claudio. I can be secret as a dumb man, I would have you think so; but, on my allegiance--mark you this-on my allegiance! he is in love. With who? Now that is your Grace’s part. Mark how short his answer is: With Hero, Leonato’s short daughter</p>
			<p class="character">Claudio </p>
			<p class="verseline">If this were so, so were it utt’red</p>
			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="prose">Like the old tale, my lord: ‘It is not so, nor ‘twas not so; but indeed, God forbid it should be so!’ </p>
			<p class="character">Claudio </p>
			<p class="prose">If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it should be otherwise</p>
			<p class="character">Don Pedro </p>
			<p class="verseline">Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy</p>
			<p class="character">Claudio </p>
			<p class="verseline">You speak this to fetch me in, my lord</p>
			<p class="character">Don Pedro </p>
			<p class="verseline">By my troth, I speak my thought</p>
			<p class="character">Claudio </p>
			<p class="verseline">And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine</p>
			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="verseline">And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine</p>
			<p class="character">Claudio </p>
			<p class="verseline">That I love her, I feel</p>
			<p class="character">Don Pedro </p>
			<p class="verseline">That she is worthy, I know</p>
			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="prose">That I neither feel how she should be loved, nor know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me. I will die in it at the stake</p>
			<p class="character">Don Pedro </p>
			<p class="prose">Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty</p>
			<p class="character">Claudio </p>
			<p class="prose">And never could maintain his part but in the force of his will</p>
			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="prose">That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she brought me up, I likewise give her most humble thanks; but that I will have a rechate winded in my forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick, all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the right to trust none; and the fine is (for the which I may go the finer), I will live a bachelor</p>
			<p class="character">Don Pedro </p>
			<p class="verseline">I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love</p>
			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="prose">With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord; not with love. Prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again with drinking, pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker’s pen and hang me up at the door of a brothel house for the sign of blind Cupid</p>
			<p class="character">Don Pedro </p>
			<p class="prose">Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou wilt prove a notable argument</p>
			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="prose">If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me; and he that hits me, let him be clapp’d on the shoulder and call’d Adam</p>
			<p class="character">Don Pedro </p>
			<p class="verseline">Well, as time shall try. ‘In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke.’ </p>
			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="prose">The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull’s horns and set them in my forehead, and let me be vilely painted, and in such great letters as they write ‘Here is good horse to hire,’ let them signify under my sign ‘Here you may see Benedick the married man.’ </p>
			<p class="character">Claudio </p>
			<p class="verseline">If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad</p>
			<p class="character">Don Pedro </p>
			<p class="prose">Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly</p>
			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="verseline">I look for an earthquake too then</p>
			<p class="character">Don Pedro </p>
			<p class="prose">Well, you will temporize with the hours. In the meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to Leonato’s, commend me to him and tell him I will not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made great preparation</p>
			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="prose">I have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage; and so I commit you-- </p>
			<p class="character">Claudio </p>
			<p class="verseline">To the tuition of God. From my house--if I had it-- </p>
			<p class="character">Don Pedro </p>
			<p class="verseline">The sixth of July. Your loving friend, Benedick</p>
			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="prose">Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and the guards are but slightly basted on neither. Ere you flout old ends any further, examine your conscience. And so I leave you</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Exit</h2>
			<p class="character">Claudio </p>
			<p class="verseline">My liege, your Highness now may do me good</p>
			<p class="character">Don Pedro </p>
			<p class="verseline">My love is thine to teach. Teach it but how, And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn Any hard lesson that may do thee good</p>
			<p class="character">Claudio </p>
			<p class="verseline">Hath Leonato any son, my lord? </p>
			<p class="character">Don Pedro </p>
			<p class="verseline">No child but Hero; she’s his only heir</p>
			<p class="verseline">Dost thou affect her, Claudio? </p>
			<p class="character">Claudio </p>
			<p class="verseline">O my lord, </p>
			<p class="verseline">When you went onward on this ended action, </p>
			<p class="verseline">I look’d upon her with a soldier’s eye, </p>
			<p class="verseline">That lik’d, but had a rougher task in hand </p>
			<p class="verseline">Than to drive liking to the name of love; </p>
			<p class="verseline">But now I am return’d and that war-thoughts </p>
			<p class="verseline">Have left their places vacant, in their rooms </p>
			<p class="verseline">Come thronging soft and delicate desires, </p>
			<p class="verseline">All prompting me how fair young Hero is, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Saying I lik’d her ere I went to wars</p>
			<p class="character">Don Pedro </p>
			<p class="verseline">Thou wilt be like a lover presently </p>
			<p class="verseline">And tire the hearer with a book of words</p>
			<p class="verseline">If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And I will break with her and with her father, </p>

			<p class="character">Antonio </p>
			<p class="prose">He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of</p>
			<p class="character">Leonato </p>
			<p class="verseline">Are they good? </p>
			<p class="character">Antonio </p>
			<p class="prose">As the event stamps them; but they have a good cover, they show well outward. The Prince and Count Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine: the Prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance, and if he found her accordant, he meant to take the present time by the top and instantly break with you of it</p>
			<p class="character">Leonato </p>
			<p class="verseline">Hath the fellow any wit that told you this? </p>
			<p class="character">Antonio </p>
			<p class="prose">A good sharp fellow. I will send for him, and question him yourself</p>
			<p class="character">Leonato </p>
			<p class="verseline">No, no. We will hold it as a dream till it appear itself; but I will acquaint my daughter withal, that she may be the better prepared for an answer, if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it</p>

			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Enter Sir John the Bastard and Conrade, his companion</h2>
			<p class="character">Conrade </p>
			<p class="prose">What the goodyear, my lord! Why are you thus out of measure sad? </p>
			<p class="character">Don John </p>
			<p class="prose">There is no measure in the occasion that breeds; therefore the sadness is without limit</p>
			<p class="character">Conrade </p>
			<p class="verseline">You should hear reason</p>
			<p class="character">Don John </p>
			<p class="verseline">And when I have heard it, what blessings brings it? </p>
			<p class="character">Conrade </p>
			<p class="verseline">If not a present remedy, at least a patient sufferance</p>
			<p class="character">Don John </p>
			<p class="prose">I wonder that thou (being, as thou say’st thou art, born under Saturn) goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide what I am: I must be sad when I have cause, and smile at no man’s jests; eat when I have stomach, and wait for no man’s leisure; sleep when I am drowsy, and tend on no man’s business; laugh when I am merry, and claw no man in his humour</p>
			<p class="character">Conrade </p>
			<p class="prose">Yea, but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment. You have of late stood out against your brother, and he hath ta’en you newly into his grace, where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself. It is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest</p>
			<p class="character">Don John </p>
			<p class="prose">I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace, and it better fits my blood to be disdain’d of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any. In this, though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchis’d with a clog; therefore I have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do my liking. In the meantime let me be that I am, and seek not to alter me</p>
			<p class="character">Conrade </p>
			<p class="verseline">Can you make no use of your discontent? </p>
			<p class="character">Don John </p>
			<p class="verseline">I make all use of it, for I use it only</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Enter Borachio</h2>
			<p class="verseline">Who comes here? What news, Borachio? </p>
			<p class="character">Borachio </p>
			<p class="prose">I came yonder from a great supper. The Prince your brother is royally entertain’d by Leonato, and I can give you intelligence of an intended marriage</p>
			<p class="character">Don John </p>
			<p class="verseline">Will it serve for any model to build mischief on? </p>
			<p class="verseline">What is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness? </p>
			<p class="character">Borachio </p>
			<p class="verseline">Marry, it is your brother’s right hand</p>
			<p class="character">Don John </p>
			<p class="verseline">Who? the most exquisite Claudio? </p>
			<p class="character">Borachio </p>
			<p class="verseline">Even he</p>
			<p class="character">Don John </p>
			<p class="verseline">A proper squire! And who? and who? which way looks he? </p>
			<p class="character">Borachio </p>
			<p class="verseline">Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato</p>
			<p class="character">Don John </p>
			<p class="verseline">A very forward March-chick! How came you to this? </p>
			<p class="character">Borachio </p>
			<p class="prose">Being entertain’d for a perfumer, as I was smoking a musty room, comes me the Prince and Claudio, hand in hand in sad conference. I whipt me behind the arras and there heard it agreed upon that the Prince should woo Hero for himself, and having obtain’d her, give her to Count Claudio</p>
			<p class="character">Don John </p>
			<p class="prose">Come, come, let us thither. This may prove food to my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the glory of my overthrow. If I can cross him any way, I bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me? </p>
			<p class="character">Conrade </p>
			<p class="verseline">To the death, my lord</p>
			<p class="character">Don John </p>
			<p class="verseline">Let us to the great supper. Their cheer is the greater that </p>
			<p class="prose">I am subdued. Would the cook were o’ my mind! Shall we go prove what’s to be done? </p>

			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Enter Leonato, [Antonio] his Brother, Hero his Daughter, and Beatrice his Niece, and a Kinsman; [also Margaret and Ursula]</h2>
			<p class="character">Leonato </p>
			<p class="verseline">Was not Count John here at supper? </p>
			<p class="character">Antonio </p>
			<p class="verseline">I saw him not</p>
			<p class="character">Beatrice </p>
			<p class="prose">How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see him but I am heart-burn’d an hour after</p>
			<p class="character">Hero </p>
			<p class="verseline">He is of a very melancholy disposition</p>
			<p class="character">Beatrice </p>
			<p class="prose">He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and Benedick. The one is too like an image and says nothing, and the other too like my lady’s eldest son, evermore tattling</p>
			<p class="character">Leonato </p>
			<p class="prose">Then half Signior Benedick’s tongue in Count John’s mouth, and half Count John’s melancholy in Signior Benedick’s face-- </p>
			<p class="character">Beatrice </p>
			<p class="prose">With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman in the world--if ‘a could get her good will</p>
			<p class="character">Leonato </p>
			<p class="prose">By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue</p>
			<p class="character">Antonio </p>
			<p class="verseline">In faith, she’s too curst</p>
			<p class="character">Beatrice </p>
			<p class="prose">Too curst is more than curst. I shall lessen God’s sending that way, for it is said, ‘God sends a curst cow short horns,’ but to a cow too curst he sends none</p>
			<p class="character">Leonato </p>
			<p class="verseline">So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns</p>
			<p class="character">Beatrice </p>
			<p class="prose">Just, if he send me no husband; for the which blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and evening. Lord, I could not endure a husband with a beard on his face. I had rather lie in the woollen! </p>
			<p class="character">Leonato </p>
			<p class="verseline">You may light on a husband that hath no beard</p>
			<p class="character">Beatrice </p>
			<p class="prose">What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting gentlewoman? He that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no beard is less than a man; and he that is more than a youth is not for me; and he that is less than a man, I am not for him. Therefore I will even take sixpence in earnest of the berrord and lead his apes into hell</p>
			<p class="character">Leonato </p>
			<p class="verseline">Well then, go you into hell? </p>
			<p class="character">Beatrice </p>
			<p class="prose">No; but to the gate, and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head, and say ‘Get you to heaven, </p>
			<p class="prose">Beatrice, get you to heaven. Here’s no place for you maids.’ So deliver I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter--for the heavens. He shows me where the bachelors sit, and there live we as merry as the day is long</p>
			<p class="character">Antonio </p>
			<p class="prose">[to Hero] Well, niece, I trust you will be rul’d by your father</p>
			<p class="character">Beatrice </p>
			<p class="verseline">Yes faith. It is my cousin’s duty to make cursy and say, </p>
			<p class="prose">‘Father, as it please you.’ But yet for all that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else make another cursy, and say, ‘Father, as it please me.’ </p>
			<p class="character">Leonato </p>
			<p class="verseline">Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband</p>
			<p class="character">Beatrice </p>
			<p class="prose">Not till God make men of some other metal than earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be overmaster’d with a piece of valiant dust? to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl? No, uncle, I’ll none. Adam’s sons are my brethren, and truly I hold it a sin to match in my kinred</p>
			<p class="character">Leonato </p>
			<p class="prose">Daughter, remember what I told you. If the Prince do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer</p>
			<p class="character">Beatrice </p>
			<p class="prose">The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be not wooed in good time. If the Prince be too important, tell him there is measure in everything, and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero: wooing, wedding, and repenting is as a Scotch jig, a measure, and a cinque-pace: the first suit is hot and hasty like a Scotch jig--and full as fantastical; the wedding, mannerly modest, as a measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes Repentance and with his bad legs falls into the cinque-pace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave</p>
			<p class="character">Leonato </p>
			<p class="verseline">Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly</p>
			<p class="character">Beatrice </p>

			<p class="prose">Why, he is the Prince’s jester, a very dull fool. Only his gift is in devising impossible slanders. None but libertines delight in him; and the commendation is not in his wit, but in his villany; for he both pleases men and angers them, and then they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in the fleet. I would he had boarded me</p>

I told him, and I think I told him true, that your Grace had got the good will of this young lady, and I off’red him my company to a willow tree, either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipt</p>
			<p class="character">Don Pedro </p>

She told me, not thinking I had been myself, that I was the Prince’s jester, that I was duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs. If her breath were as terrible as her terminations, there were no living near her; she would infect to the North Star. I would not marry her though she were endowed with all that Adam had left him before he transgress’d. She would have made Hercules have turn’d spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make the fire too. Come, talk not of her. You shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God some scholar would conjure her, for certainly, while she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose, because they would go thither; so indeed all disquiet, horror, and perturbation follows her</p>

They will scarcely believe this without trial. Offer them instances; which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamber window, hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding (for in the meantime I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be absent) and there shall appear such seeming truth of Hero’s disloyalty that jealousy shall be call’d assurance and all the preparation overthrown</p>

I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe. I have known when he would have walk’d ten mile afoot to see a good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man and a soldier; and now is he turn’d orthography; his words are a very fantastical banquet-- just so many strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not. I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster; but I’ll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster of me he shall never make me such a fool. One woman is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in my grace. Rich she shall be, that’s certain; wise, or I’ll none; virtuous, or I’ll never cheapen her; fair, or I’ll never look on her; mild, or come not near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall be of what colour it please God.

The sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of another’s dotage, and no such matter. That’s the scene that I would see, which will be merely a dumb show.

			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="prose">This can be no trick. The conference was sadly borne; they have the truth of this from Hero; they seem to pity the lady. It seems her affections have their full bent. Love me? Why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censur’d. They say I will bear myself proudly if I perceive the love come from her. They say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection. I did never think to marry. I must not seem proud. Happy are they that hear their detractions and can put them to mending. They say the lady is fair--’tis a truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous--’tis so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving me--by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor no great argument of her folly, for I will be horribly in love with her. I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because I have railed so long against marriage. But doth not the appetite alters? A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age. Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour? No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I were married</p>

			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="verseline">You take pleasure then in the message? </p>
			<p class="character">Beatrice </p>
			<p class="prose">Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knives point, and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach, signior. Fare you well</p>

			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="verseline">Ha! ‘Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.’ T</p>
			<p class="prose">here’s a double meaning in that. ‘I took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me.’ That’s as much as to say, ‘Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks.’ If I do not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not love her, I am a Jew.

			<p class="verseline">Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman </p>

			<p class="character">Hero </p>
			<p class="verseline">O god of love! I know he doth deserve </p>
			<p class="verseline">As much as may be yielded to a man: </p>
			<p class="verseline">But Nature never fram’d a woman’s heart </p>
			<p class="verseline">Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice</p>

			<p class="verseline">Sure I think so; </p>

			<p class="verseline">Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man, </p>
			<p class="verseline">How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featur’d, </p>
			<p class="verseline">But she would spell him backward. If fair-fac’d, </p>
			<p class="verseline">She would swear the gentleman should be her sister; </p>
			<p class="verseline">If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antic, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed; </p>
			<p class="verseline">If low, an agate very vilely cut; </p>
			<p class="verseline">If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds; </p>
			<p class="verseline">If silent, why, a block moved with none</p>

			<p class="prose">Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold with Benedick for his company; for, from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all mirth. He hath twice or thrice cut Cupid’s bowstring, and the little hangman dare not shoot at him. He hath a heart as sound as a bell; and his tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks, his tongue speaks</p>

			<p class="character">Claudio </p>
			<p class="verseline">Yet say I he is in love</p>
			<p class="character">Don Pedro </p>
			<p class="prose">There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as to be a Dutchman to-day, a Frenchman to-morrow; or in the shape of two countries at once, as a German from the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is</p>
			<p class="character">Claudio </p>

			<p class="prose">Nay, but his jesting spirit, which is new-crept into a lutestring, and now govern’d by stops</p>
			<p class="character">Don Pedro </p>
			<p class="prose">Indeed that tells a heavy tale for him. Conclude, conclude, he is in love</p>
			<p class="character">Claudio </p>
			<p class="verseline">Nay, but I know who loves him</p>

			<p class="character">Dogberry </p>
			<p class="prose">You have. I knew it would be your answer. Well, for your favour, sir, why, give God thanks and make no boast of it; and for your writing and reading, let that appear when there is no need of such vanity. You are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch. Therefore bear you the lanthorn. This is your charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are to bid any man stand, in the Prince’s name. 2. Watch. How if ‘a will not stand? </p>
			<p class="character">Dogberry </p>
			<p class="prose">Why then, take no note of him, but let him go, and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank God you are rid ofa knave</p>
			<p class="character">Verges </p>
			<p class="verseline">If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none of the Prince’s subjects</p>
			<p class="character">Dogberry </p>
			<p class="prose">True, and they are to meddle with none but the Prince’s subjects. You shall also make no noise in the streets; for for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable, and not to be endured. 2. Watch. We will rather sleep than talk. We know what belongs to a watch</p>
			<p class="character">Dogberry </p>
			<p class="prose">Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman, for I cannot see how sleeping should offend. Only have a care that your bills be not stol’n. Well, you are to call at all the alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed. 2. Watch. How if they will not? </p>
			<p class="character">Dogberry </p>
			<p class="prose">Why then, let them alone till they are sober. If they make you not then the better answer, You may say they are not the men you took them for. 2. Watch. Well, sir</p>
			<p class="character">Dogberry </p>
			<p class="prose">If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue of your office, to be no true man; and for such kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them, why, the more your honesty. 2. Watch. If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay hands on him? </p>
			<p class="character">Dogberry </p>
			<p class="prose">Truly, by your office you may; but I think they that touch pitch will be defil’d. The most peaceable way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him show himself what he is, and steal out of your company</p>
			<p class="character">Verges </p>
			<p class="verseline">You have been always called a merciful man, partner</p>
			<p class="character">Dogberry </p>
			<p class="prose">Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more a man who hath any honesty in him</p>
			<p class="character">Verges </p>
			<p class="prose">If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call to the nurse and bid her still it. 2. Watch. How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us? </p>
			<p class="character">Dogberry </p>
			<p class="prose">Why then, depart in peace and let the child wake her with crying; for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats</p>
			<p class="character">Verges </p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Tis very true</p>
			<p class="character">Dogberry </p>
			<p class="prose">This is the end of the charge: you, constable, are to present the Prince’s own person. If you meet the Prince in the night, you may stay him</p>
			<p class="character">Verges </p>
			<p class="verseline">Nay, by’r lady, that I think ‘a cannot</p>
			<p class="character">Dogberry </p>
			<p class="prose">Five shillings to one on’t with any man that knows the statutes, he may stay him! Marry, not without the Prince be willing; for indeed the watch ought to offend no man, and it is an offence to stay a man against his will</p>
			<p class="character">Verges </p>
			<p class="verseline">By’r lady, I think it be so</p>
			<p class="character">Dogberry </p>
			<p class="prose">Ha, ah, ha! Well, masters, good night. An there be any matter of weight chances, call up me. Keep your fellows’ counsels and your own, and good night. Come, neighbour</p>
			<p class="prose">2. Watch. Well, masters, we hear our charge. Let us go sit here upon the church bench till two, and then all to bed</p>
			<p class="character">Dogberry </p>
			<p class="verseline">One word more, honest neighbours. I pray you watch about Signior Leonato’s door; for the wedding being there tomorrow, there is a great coil to-night. Adieu. Be vigitant, I beseech you</p>

			<p class="character">Conrade </p>
			<p class="verseline">Here, man. I am at thy elbow</p>
			<p class="character">Borachio </p>
			<p class="prose">Mass, and my elbow itch’d! I thought there would a scab follow</p>
			<p class="character">Conrade </p>
			<p class="prose">I will owe thee an answer for that; and now forward with thy tale</p>
			<p class="character">Borachio </p>
			<p class="prose">Stand thee close then under this penthouse, for it drizzles rain, and I will, like a true drunkard, utter all to thee. 2. Watch. <span class="stage_directions_inline">[aside]</span> Some treason, masters. Yet stand close</p>
			<p class="character">Borachio </p>
			<p class="verseline">Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats</p>
			<p class="character">Conrade </p>
			<p class="verseline">Is it possible that any villany should be so dear? </p>
			<p class="character">Borachio </p>
			<p class="prose">Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villany should be so rich; for when rich villains have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what price they will</p>
			<p class="character">Conrade </p>
			<p class="verseline">I wonder at it</p>
			<p class="character">Borachio </p>
			<p class="prose">That shows thou art unconfirm’d. Thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is nothing to a man</p>
			<p class="character">Conrade </p>
			<p class="verseline">Yes, it is apparel</p>
			<p class="character">Borachio </p>
			<p class="verseline">I mean the fashion</p>
			<p class="character">Conrade </p>
			<p class="verseline">Yes, the fashion is the fashion</p>
			<p class="character">Borachio </p>
			<p class="prose">Tush! I may as well say the fool’s the fool. But seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion is? 2. Watch. [aside] I know that Deformed. ‘A bas been a vile thief this seven year; ‘a goes up and down like a gentleman. I remember his name</p>
			<p class="character">Borachio </p>
			<p class="verseline">Didst thou not hear somebody? </p>
			<p class="character">Conrade </p>
			<p class="verseline">No; ‘twas the vane on the house</p>
			<p class="character">Borachio </p>
			<p class="prose">Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this fashion is? how giddily ‘a turns about all the hot-bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty? sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh’s soldiers in the reechy painting, sometime like god Bel’s priests in the old church window, sometime like the shaven Hercules in the smirch’d worm-eaten tapestry, where his codpiece seems as massy as his club? </p>
			<p class="character">Conrade </p>
			<p class="prose">All this I see; and I see that the fashion wears out more apparel than the man. But art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion? </p>
			<p class="character">Borachio </p>
			<p class="prose">Not so neither. But know that I have to-night wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero’s gentlewoman, by the name of Hero. She leans me out at her mistress’ chamber window, bids me a thousand times good night--I tell this tale vilely; I should first tell thee how the Prince, Claudio and my master, planted and placed and possessed by my master Don John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter</p>
			<p class="character">Conrade </p>
			<p class="verseline">And thought they Margaret was Hero? </p>
			<p class="character">Borachio </p>
			<p class="prose">Two of them did, the Prince and Claudio; but the devil my master knew she was Margaret; and partly by his oaths, which first possess’d them, partly by the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly by my villany, which did confirm any slander that Don John had made, away went Claudio enrag’d; swore he would meet her, as he was appointed, next morning at the temple, and there, before the whole congregation, shame her with what he saw o’ernight and send her home again without a husband. 2. Watch. We charge you in the Prince’s name stand! 1. Watch. Call up the right Master Constable. We have here recover’d the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the commonwealth 2. Watch. And one Deformed is one of them. I know him; ‘a wears a lock</p>
			<p class="character">Conrade </p>
			<p class="verseline">Masters, masters-- 1. Watch. You’ll be made bring Deformed forth, I warrant you</p>
			<p class="character">Conrade </p>
			<p class="verseline">Masters-- 2. Watch. Never speak, we charge you. Let us obey you to go with us</p>
			<p class="character">Borachio </p>
			<p class="prose">We are like to prove a goodly commodity, being taken up of these men’s bills</p>

			<p class="prose">My cousin’s a fool, and thou art another. I’ll wear none but this</p>
			<p class="character">Margaret </p>
			<p class="prose">I like the new tire within excellently, if the hair were a thought browner; and your gown’s a most rare fashion, i’ faith. I saw the Duchess of Milan’s gown that they praise so</p>

			<p class="prose">By my troth, ‘s but a nightgown in respect of yours-- cloth-o’-gold and cuts, and lac’d with silver, set with pearls down sleeves, side-sleeves, and skirts, round underborne with a blush tinsel. But for a fine, quaint, graceful, and excellent fashion, yours is worth ten on’t</p>

I think you would have me say, ‘saving your reverence, a husband.’ An bad thinking do not wrest true speaking, I’ll offend nobody. Is there any harm in ‘the heavier for a husband’? None, I think, an it be the right husband and the right wife. Otherwise ‘tis light, and not heavy. Ask my Lady Beatrice else. Here she comes</p>

Nay, by’r lady, I am not such a fool to think what I list; nor I list not to think what I can; nor indeed I cannot think, if I would think my heart out of thinking, that you are in love, or that you will be in love, or that you can be in love. Yet Benedick was such another, and now is he become a man. He swore he would never marry; and yet now in despite of his heart he eats his meat without grudging; and how you may be converted I know not, but methinks you look with your eyes as other women do</p>

			<p class="verseline">But you are more intemperate in your blood </p>

			<p class="character">Friar Francis </p>
			<p class="verseline">There is some strange misprision in the princes</p>
			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="verseline">Two of them have the very bent of honour; </p>
			<p class="verseline">And if their wisdoms be misled in this, </p>

			<p class="verseline">Both strength of limb and policy of mind, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Ability in means, and choice of friends, </p>
			<p class="verseline">To quit me of them throughly</p>
			<p class="character">Friar Francis </p>
			<p class="verseline">Pause awhile </p>

			<p class="verseline">Change slander to remorse. That is some good</p>
			<p class="verseline">But not for that dream I on this strange course, </p>
			<p class="verseline">But on this travail look for greater birth</p>
			<p class="verseline">She dying, as it must be so maintain’d, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Upon the instant that she was accus’d, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Shall be lamented, pitied, and excus’d </p>
			<p class="verseline">Of every hearer; for it so falls out </p>
			<p class="verseline">That what we have we prize not to the worth </p>
			<p class="verseline">Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack’d and lost, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Why, then we rack the value, then we find </p>
			<p class="verseline">The virtue that possession would not show us </p>
			<p class="verseline">Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio</p>
			<p class="verseline">When he shall hear she died upon his words, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Th’ idea of her life shall sweetly creep </p>
			<p class="verseline">Into his study of imagination, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And every lovely organ of her life </p>
			<p class="verseline">Shall come apparell’d in more precious habit, </p>
			<p class="verseline">More moving, delicate, and full of life, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Into the eye and prospect of his soul </p>
			<p class="verseline">Than when she liv’d indeed. Then shall he mourn </p>
			<p class="verseline">(If ever love had interest in his liver) </p>
			<p class="verseline">And wish he had not so accused her-- </p>
			<p class="verseline">No, though be thought his accusation true</p>
			<p class="verseline">Let this be so, and doubt not but success </p>
			<p class="verseline">Will fashion the event in better shape </p>
			<p class="verseline">Than I can lay it down in likelihood</p>
			<p class="verseline">But if all aim but this be levell’d false, </p>
			<p class="verseline">The supposition of the lady’s death </p>
			<p class="verseline">Will quench the wonder of her infamy</p>
			<p class="verseline">And if it sort not well, you may conceal her, </p>
			<p class="verseline">As best befits her wounded reputation, </p>
			<p class="verseline">In some reclusive and religious life, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Out of all eyes, tongues, minds, and injuries</p>
			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="verseline">Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you; </p>
			<p class="verseline">And though you know my inwardness and love </p>
			<p class="verseline">Is very much unto the Prince and Claudio, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this </p>
			<p class="verseline">As secretly and justly as your soul </p>
			<p class="verseline">Should with your body</p>
			<p class="character">Leonato </p>
			<p class="verseline">Being that I flow in grief, </p>
			<p class="verseline">The smallest twine may lead me</p>

			<p class="verseline">‘Tis well consented. Presently away; </p>
			<p class="verseline">For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure</p>

But manhood is melted into cursies, valour into compliment, and men are only turn’d into tongue, and trim ones too. He is now as valiant as Hercules that only tells a lie,and swears it.

			<p class="verseline">Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily</p>
			<p class="character">Don Pedro </p>
			<p class="prose">I’ll tell thee how Beatrice prais’d thy wit the other day. I said thou hadst a fine wit: ‘True,’ said she, ‘a fine little one.’ ‘No,’ said I, ‘a great wit.’ ‘Right,’ says she, ‘a great gross one.’ ‘Nay,’ said I, ‘a good wit.’ ‘Just,’ said she, ‘it hurts nobody.’ ‘Nay,’ said I, ‘the gentleman is wise.’ ‘Certain,’ said she, a wise gentleman.’ ‘Nay,’ said I, ‘he hath the tongues.’ ‘That I believe’ said she, ‘for he swore a thing to me on Monday night which he forswore on Tuesday morning. There’s a double tongue; there’s two tongues.’ Thus did she an hour together transshape thy particular virtues. Yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou wast the proper’st man in Italy</p>

			<p class="verseline">For the which she wept heartily and said she cared not</p>
			<p class="character">Don Pedro </p>
			<p class="prose">Yea, that she did; but yet, for all that, an if she did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly. The old man’s daughter told us all</p>

			<p class="character">Benedick </p>
			<p class="prose">Fare you well, boy; you know my mind. I will leave you now to your gossiplike humour. You break jests as braggards do their blades, which God be thanked hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank you. I must discontinue your company. Your brother the bastard is fled from Messina. You have among you kill’d a sweet and innocent lady. For my Lord Lackbeard there, he and I shall meet; and till then peace be with him</p>

I can find out no rhyme to ‘lady’ but ‘baby’--an innocent rhyme; for ‘scorn,’ ‘horn’--a hard rhyme; for ‘school’, ‘fool’--a babbling rhyme: very ominous endings!

Therefore is it most expedient for the wise, if Don Worm (his conscience) find no impediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet of his own virtues, as I am to myself.
